## Developer Guide

### Getting Started

To get started with Beans, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/arscslvt/beans.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev` or `bun run dev` (if you want to use Bun ‚Äî [Install Bun](https://bun.sh/))

### Setup local Supabase instance

Beans uses Supabase as the backend for storing notes. To set up a local Supabase instance for development, follow these steps:

1. Install Docker: [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. Make sure Docker is running. You can check by running `docker --version`.
3. You should see a `/supabase` folder in the root directory of the Beans project. This folder contains the necessary configuration files for setting up a local Supabase instance.
4. Run the following command to start the Supabase instance:

```bash
supabase start
```

5. Wait for the Supabase instance to start. You should see a message indicating that the instance is running.
6. Once the Supabase instance is running, it will print out the connection details. You can use these details to connect to the local Supabase instance from the Beans app.\
   Example connection details:

```bash
Started supabase local development setup.

         API URL: http://localhost:54321
          DB URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres
      Studio URL: http://localhost:54323
    Inbucket URL: http://localhost:54324
        anon key: eyJh......
service_role key: eyJh......
```

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the Beans project and add the following environment variables:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://localhost:54321 (API URL)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY=eyJh...... (service_role key)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJh...... (anon key)
```
